    answer: `Carbon accounting tracks greenhouse gas emissions across three scopes:<br><br>
             <strong>Scope 1:</strong> Direct emissions from owned/controlled sources (e.g., company vehicles, on-site fuel combustion)<br>
             <strong>Scope 2:</strong> Indirect emissions from purchased energy (e.g., electricity, heating)<br>
             <strong>Scope 3:</strong> All other indirect emissions (e.g., supply chain, business travel, investments)<br><br>
             <em>Pro Tip:</em> Start with Scope 1 & 2 measurements before tackling Scope 3. Use the <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/" target="_blank">GHG Protocol</a> for methodology.`,

  "scope 3": {
    answer: `Scope 3 emissions include 15 categories like:<br><br>
             • Purchased goods/services<br>
             • Capital goods<br>
             • Fuel/energy-related activities<br>
             • Transportation/distribution<br>
             • Waste generated in operations<br><br>
             <strong>Quick Win:</strong> Focus on Category 1 (purchased goods) first—it typically represents 40-80% of Scope 3 emissions.`,

  "esg score": {
    answer: `To improve your ESG score:<br><br>
             1. <strong>Disclosure:</strong> Publish annual ESG reports aligned with SASB/GRI standards<br>
             2. <strong>Targets:</strong> Set science-based carbon reduction targets (SBTi)<br>
             3. <strong>Governance:</strong> Add independent directors and link executive pay to ESG metrics<br><br>
             <em>Note:</em> Scoring methodologies vary between MSCI, Sustainalytics, and S&P Global.`,
